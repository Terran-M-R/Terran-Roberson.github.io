      <p>Hello! I am a freshman at the University of Texas at San Antonio through the Coordinated Admissions Program. 
        I aspire to be a professional in management information systems. I have a passion for utilizing technology to solve business challenges and 
        collaborating with diverse teams. From using CAD programs to make efficient designs to developing resolutions with peers at the UN in 
        The Hague, Netherlands, I learned invaluable skills that I can utilize to produce meaningful solutions. I am eager to learn and contribute 
        to innovative teams through internships and campus opportunities while pursuing a career in MIS. Currently, I am a member of several technical field based
        organizations such as NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers), ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), and ASCM (Association for Supply Chain Management).
